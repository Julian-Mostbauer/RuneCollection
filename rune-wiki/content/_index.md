# RuneCollection

**Unlock the secrets of magic, one rune at a time.**

In this world, magic isn’t cast—it’s crafted. Every spell is a carefully constructed sequence of runes, a language of intent, power, and transformation. By combining **targeting runes**, **effects**, and **modifiers**, you can shape raw arcane energy into anything your imagination allows—whether it’s a fiery projectile, a protective ward, or a zone of chaotic magic.

Magic here is modular. Think of runes as the building blocks of reality:
- **Targeting runes** decide *who* or *what* your magic touches.
- **Effect runes** determine *what* happens.
- **Modifiers** fine-tune the details, altering size, intensity, shape, or behavior.

Whether you’re launching a precise bolt at a distant foe, engulfing an area in roaring flames, or creating subtle enchantments that bend the world to your will, the rune system gives you infinite possibilities.

Below, you’ll find the rules for constructing your rune setups, manuals for targeting and effect runes, and examples to inspire your own magical creations. Let the runes speak—and let your creativity shape their meaning.

## Example Spells

### Fireball

Using the rune system above, here's how to recreate the classic fireball spell:

**Rune Setup**: `Projectile` → `Explosion` → `Fire` + `Range`

**How it works**:
1. **Projectile** (Target): Launches in a direction, travels until it hits something or reaches max range
2. **Explosion** (Effect): Creates a blast that radiates outward from impact point
3. **Fire** (Modifier): Adds fire damage (crc d6 + 2) and potential burning effects
4. **Range** (Modifier): Increases explosion radius by 5 ft for better area coverage

**Alternative Builds**:
- `Projectile` + `Count` → `Explosion` → `Fire` + `Intensity` = Multiple smaller fireballs
- `Entity` → `Explosion` → `Fire` + `Force` = Touch-range fireball that also pushes enemies
- `Projectile` → `Area` → `Fire` + `Range` = Creates a lingering fire zone instead of instant explosion
- `Self` + `Area` → `Explosion` + `Force` + `Intensity` + `Fire` = Kamikaze
