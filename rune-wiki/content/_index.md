# Rune Collection — Player's Guide

**Unlock the secrets of magic, one rune at a time.**

This tome is written for casters, scribes, and would-be arcanists who wish to learn the craft of rune magic. Think of runes as components in a spell: combining them in specific orders and contexts produces effects that are reliable, repeatable, and—when wielded poorly—dangerous.

## Chapter 1 — The Basics

- Components: Targeting Runes (who/what), Effect Runes (what happens), Modifiers (how it changes)
- Casting Time: Usually an action. Some runes explicitly change timing.
- Range: Determined by targeting rune and range modifiers.
- Duration: Effects either instant, sustained, or persistent; many modifiers alter duration.

## How to Read This Book

Each rune entry lists its purpose, mechanical effect, common modifiers, and example uses. Read the rune names as you would spell components in a recipe: the order matters.

## Quick Reference

- `Targeting → Effect + Modifier`
  - Example: `Projectile → Explosion + Fire` — Launch a projectile that explodes into fire on impact.

## Example Spell: Fireball

Rune Setup: `Projectile` → `Explosion` → `Fire` + `Range`

Mechanics:
1. Projectile (Target): Create a moving object. Travels until it hits or reaches max range.
2. Explosion (Effect): On impact, create a blast centered on the impact point.
3. Fire (Modifier): Adds fire damage (see Damage Rules, p. X).
4. Range (Modifier): Increase explosion radius.

Alternate Builds:
- `Projectile + Count → Explosion → Fire + Intensity` — Multiple smaller balls.
- `Entity → Explosion → Fire + Force` — A touch-range blast that also knocks back.
